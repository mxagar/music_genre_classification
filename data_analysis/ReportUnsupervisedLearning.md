# Unsupervised Learning Techniques Applied to the Songs Dataset from Spotify

This document summarizes the results obtained after applying unsupervised learning techniques to the [Dataset of Songs from Spotify](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify).


### Requirements

- Section describing the dataset
- Paragraph with objective of the analysis: clustering / dimensionality reduction; benefits for stakeholders?
- Brief description of data processing: EDA, FE, etc.
- Unsupervised learning model: why good? at least 3 variations (e.g., 3 clustering algorithms, 3 different hyperparameter sets)?
- Key findings
- Action plans to fix flaws, next steps
