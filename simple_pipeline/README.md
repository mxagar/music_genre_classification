# Packaging of Pipeline for Production without Tracking

This folder replicates the pipeline steps defined in the upper level but *without* MLflow and Weights and Biases.

Basically, the code is transformed into classes and embedded in a Scikit-Learn Pipeline.

Then, an API is created and deployed as a docker image.

TBD.
